I find it easier to explain them in this order.

And I expanded the method sections with examples and a bit more of information.

I removed the most complex example in the intro, as I think the examples in the sections will make a better job now at explaining the most complex cases.

pandas-dev/pandas,61454,BUG: Raise TypeError when joining with non-DataFrame using 'on=' (GH#61434),"Closes GH#61434

### What does this PR change?

When using `DataFrame.join()` with the `on` parameter, passing an invalid object like a `dict`, `int`, or third-party DataFrame previously resulted in unclear internal errors.

This PR adds a minimal type check that raises a clear `TypeError` when `other` is not a `DataFrame`, `Series`, or a list of such objects. Valid list-based joins without `on` remain unaffected.

pandas-dev/pandas,61451,BUG: Fix DataFrame constructor misclassification of array-like with 'name' attribute (#61443),"BUG: Fix DataFrame constructor misclassification of array-like with 'name' attribute

Previously, any object with a `.name` attribute (like some `vtkArray`-like objects) was assumed to be a `Series` or `Index`, causing the DataFrame constructor to misinterpret the input and raise errors when passed valid 2D array-likes.

This fix ensures we only apply the named-Series/Index logic when the input is **actually** an instance of `ABCSeries` or `ABCIndex`, and the `name` is not `None`.

A new test was added to ensure array-like subclasses with `.name` are handled correctly.

This simplifiers wheel builds for free-threaded CPython, which is useful in itself and I thought was a good idea before backporting the Windows cp313t wheel support to the 2.3.x branch, as just discussed at https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/61249#issuecomment-2885514360.

This should have no changes in behavior, and mostly reverts the workarounds for unreleased Cython added initially in gh-60146. Other notes:
- Changes the `free-threaded-support` cibuildwheel setting to `enable`, because the former is now deprecated.
- This leaves the license concatenation behavior unchanged. Note that it's skipped on Windows, and happens on other platforms. This was added without any discussion in gh-60146. It looks inconsistent, but the bash invocation doesn't work on Windows so I'd like to leave it unchanged in this PR. A useful follow-up PR may be to remove the ad-hoc concatenation in favor of starting to use [PEP 639](https://peps.python.org/pep-0639/).

pandas-dev/pandas,61441,BUG: Raise ValueError on integer indexers containing NA; skip test for unsupported EAs,"- [ ] closes #56727
- [ ] [Tests added and passed](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/development/contributing_codebase.html#writing-tests) if fixing a bug or adding a new feature
- [ ] All [code checks passed](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/development/contributing_codebase.html#pre-commit).

- [ ] Added an entry in the latest `doc/source/whatsnew/vX.X.X.rst` file if fixing a bug or adding a new feature.
This PR addresses missing validation in `_setitem_with_indexer`, where indexing with integer indexers containing `pd.NA` (e.g., `Int64` arrays with missing values) would silently fail or misbehave.

### What this PR changes:

- Adds a check to `_setitem_with_indexer` to raise a `ValueError` when NA is present in the indexer.
- Updates `test_setitem_integer_with_missing_raises` to skip test cases for known `ExtensionArray` types (`PeriodArray`, `DatetimeArray`, `IntervalArray`) that do not support indexing with NA in integer indexers.

- combining RUN commands to minimise the number of layers 
- removing the apt lists files to reduce total size

In my tests it reduced the size of the final image with approximately 0.47GB (most of it due to the --no-cache-dir).

The Int32Dtype type allows representing integers with support for null values (pd.NA). However, when using .map(f) or .apply(f), the elements passed to f are converted to float64, and pd.NA is transformed into np.nan.

This happens because .map() and .apply() internally use numpy, which automatically converts the data to float64, even when the original type is Int32Dtype.

The fix (just remove the method to_numpy()) ensures that when using .map() or .apply(), the elements in the series retain their original type (Int32, Float64, boolean, etc.), preventing unnecessary conversions to float64 and ensuring that pd.NA remains correctly handled.",open,2025-05-03T21:54:02+00:00,2025-05-19T13:11:11+00:00,,,aea8e4e09e761e7c59c61abc311e751c22204190,pedromfdiogo,32,1,4,0,0,5,False,https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/61396,{}

pandas-dev/pandas,61391,"fix MultiIndex.difference not working with PyArrow timestamps (#61382) ,and some ruff formating fix","## Problem
The `MultiIndex.difference` method fails to remove entries when the index contains PyArrow-backed timestamps (`timestamp[ns][pyarrow]`). This occurs because direct tuple comparisons with PyArrow scalar types are unreliable during membership checks, causing entries to remain unexpectedly.

**Example**:
```python
# PyArrow timestamp index
df = DataFrame(...).astype({""date"": ""timestamp[ns][pyarrow]""}).set_index([""id"", ""date""])
idx_val = df.index[0]
new_index = df.index.difference([idx_val])  # Fails to remove idx_val
```
Solution
Code Conversion: Map other values to integer codes compatible with the original index's levels.

Engine Validation: Use the MultiIndex's internal engine for membership checks, ensuring accurate handling of PyArrow types.

Mask-Based Exclusion: Create a boolean mask to filter out matched entries, then reconstruct the index.

pandas-dev/pandas,61381,"Fix alignment in Series subtraction with MultiIndex, Index and NaN values (#60908)","This pull request fixes #60908 , where subtracting a Series with a MultiIndex containing NaN values from a Series with a regular Index could lead to incorrect results or unexpected behavior.

The issue was caused by the _align_for_op method not properly handling cases where the left-hand Series had a MultiIndex and the right-hand side had a flat Index, especially when NaN values were present. This could lead to misalignment during arithmetic operations.

To fix this, the _align_for_op method was updated to:

- Ensure that when the left Series has a MultiIndex and the right Series has a regular Index, the right Series is properly reindexed based on the first level of the left-hand MultiIndex, even when NaN values are involved.

- Correctly handle cases where either Series is empty.

Additionally, a new test test_series_subtraction_with_nan_and_levels (added in test_subtraction_nanindex) was introduced to verify that:

- Subtracting a Series with a MultiIndex (including NaNs) from a regular Index works correctly.

- The result maintains the correct alignment and expected output values.",open,2025-04-30T11:21:39+00:00,2025-05-18T19:35:14+00:00,,,91837dd03b46412636f3763e478ea3434395051a,rit4rosa,58,17,2,1,0,2,False,https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/61381,{}
pandas-dev/pandas,61380,ENH: Implement translations infrastructure,"Hello team! 

This PR is a proposal for adding the translations infrastructure to the pandas web page.

Following the discussion in https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/56301, we (a group of folks working on the Scientific Python grant) have been working to set up infrastructure and translate the contents of the pandas web site. As of this moment, we have 100% translations for the pandas website into Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese, with other languages available for translation (depending on volunteer translators).

To build, the command remains the same:

```bash
python pandas_web.py pandas/content --target-path build
```

If you want to check out other related work, please take a look at https://github.com/scipy/scipy.org/pull/617

You an read more about how the translation process works at https://scientific-python-translations.github.io/docs/

pandas-dev/pandas,61379,DOC: Fix dark mode text visibility in Getting Started accordion (#60024),"- [x] closes [#61377](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/61377) (duplicate of [#60024](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/60024))

### 📄 **Description**

This pull request fixes the issue described in [#61377](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/61377), where the text in the accordion content of the *Getting Started* tutorial section was not visible in dark mode.

Although #61377 is a duplicate, the underlying problem was originally reported in [#60024](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/60024), and later duplicated in [#60041](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/60041) and [#60921](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/60921). This PR addresses the root cause described in those issues.

### ✅ **Changes Made**

Added CSS variables to ensure that text and background colors are consistent with the active theme:

```css
.tutorial-card .card-header {
  --bs-card-cap-color: var(--pst-color-text-base);
  color: var(--pst-color-text-base);
  cursor: pointer;
  background-color: var(--pst-color-surface);
  border: 1px solid var(--pst-color-border);
}

.tutorial-card .card-body {
  background-color: var(--pst-color-on-background);
  color: var(--pst-color-text-base);
}
```

pandas-dev/pandas,61374,Percentile Scaling Data Transformation,"This pull request adds a new data transformation utility called `percentile_scaling` to the `pandas/io/` module, which scales numerical data to a percentile-based range from 0 to 100. This transformation is useful for standardizing features in data preprocessing workflows, especially for ML pipelines or percentile-based visual analytics.

Implementation Details

- Introduced a new function `percentile_scaling(data: List[float]) -> List[float]` that:
  - Accepts a list or NumPy array of numerical values.
  - Returns values scaled to a [0, 100] percentile scale.
  - Raises appropriate errors for invalid input (e.g., zero variance or empty input).

Tests

- Added unit tests in `pandas/tests/io/test_percentile_scaling.py`:
  - Validates correct scaling behavior.
  - Handles edge cases such as identical values and empty inputs.
  - All tests pass successfully using `unittest`.

Compliance

- [x] Follows Pandas contribution guidelines
- [x] All tests pass successfully
- [x] Function is self-contained and does not introduce dependencies
- [x] Code is PEP8-compliant and cleanly documented

Notes

This contribution is part of a university-level data engineering course project (DATA 226). The goal is to implement practical transformation logic for real-world data pipeline use cases while following standard open-source contribution workflows.


- [x] Tests added and passed
- [x] Code passes style checks and pre-commit hooks

There is a slight code duplication here, but we don't need to rely on Cateorical's codes because we can just directly use groupby's.

Fixes an issue where regex patterns with alternation (|) produce different results between str dtype and string[pyarrow] dtype.

pandas-dev/pandas,61321,Fix: AttributeError when using .iloc with pyarrow-backed Series in Pandas #61311,"fix : #61311
### Solution:
The problem arises when the code tries to access `.max()` and `.min()` on `ArrowExtensionArray`. To fix this, we can replace `.max()` and `.min()` with `np.max()` and `np.min()`, which can handle these arrays correctly.

Here is the modification to be made:

```python
# check that the key does not exceed the maximum size of the index
if np.max(arr) >= len_axis or np.min(arr) < -len_axis:
    raise IndexError(""positional indexers are out-of-bounds"")
```

Stage 3. Part of an multi-stages effort: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/57880#issuecomment-2003636401
Part 2 has a issue at https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/59324
But in the process of implementing, I realized the current implementation of `df.to_latex(escape)` does not go through `styler.to_latex` but to call `styler.format_index`. This implementation follows the same flow. So maybe part 2 is not really relevant.

pandas-dev/pandas,61297,BUG: Raise clear error when assign is used with non-string column keys,"### What does this PR do?

Fixes confusing behavior when `.assign()` is used with non-string keys like tuples. Python raises a generic `TypeError: keywords must be strings`, which confuses users.

This PR adds a more helpful message:
> assign() only supports string column names. Use df[('C', 'one')] = ... to assign non-string column names like tuples.

### Why?

This improves the developer experience and avoids unnecessary debugging time.

### How was this fixed?

- Added `__kwargs_dict__` as a keyword-only argument for testing with tuple keys
- Added validation in `assign()` for string-only keys
- Updated existing test for compatibility
- Added new test: `test_assign_with_tuple_column_key_raises_typeerror`

### Test added

### Summary:

-	Fixes a 3-year-old bug with incorrect min/max rolling calculation for custom window sizes. Adds an error check for invalid inputs.
-	Speed improvement of ~10% by not using additional queue for handling NaNs.
-	For complex cases, incurs additional multiplicative log(k) complexity (where k is max window size), but this cost is only incurred in cases that produced invalid result before. For example, for constant window size this cost is not incurred.

### Changed behavior:
Has additional validity check, which will raise ValueError if the function detects a condition it cannot work with, namely improper ordering of start/end bounds. The existing method would happily consume such input and would produce a wrong result. There is a new unit test to check for the raised ValueError.

### Note on invalid inputs:

It is possible to make the method work for an arbitrary stream of start/end window bounds, but it will require sorting. It is very unlikely that such work is worth the effort, and it is estimated to have extremely low need, if any. Let someone create an enhancement request first. 
If sorting is to be implemented: it can be done with only incurring performance hit in the case of unsorted input: copy and sort the start/end arrays, producing a permutation, run the main method on the copy, and then extract the result back using the permutation. To detect if the start/end array pair is properly sorted will only take O(N). (Soring is N*log(N), does not have to be stable, but the input array is extremely likely to be “almost” sorted, and you have to pick your poison of a sorting method that works well with nearly sorted array, or use efficient soring methods, most of which do not offer additional speed on nearly sorted arrays.) Working such intermediate step (without copying and pasting) into 3 different implementations will require some less than straightforward work in the “apply” family of methods used by other rolling functions, and therefore will bear risk. If this is decided to be done, it is recommended to have an additional parameter to optionally skip the “sorted” check. (The user may already know that the arrays are properly sorted).

### How to Debug numba
You can temporarily change 2 lines of code in order to Python-debug numba implementation with VS Code or another Python debugger:
- Comment out the `numba.jit` decorator on the function(`sliding_min_max()` in `min_max_.py`). 
- Do the same with the `column_looper()` function defined inside the `generate_apply_looper()` function in **executor.py**.
- Your breakpoint inside the function will now hit!

### Misc Notes

The speed improvement of ~10% was confirmed in two ways:
-	As measured by pandas’ supplied asv benchmark suite (0.80-0.91 coefficient (depending on particular test) on my hardware).
-	With a custom load test over a 2MM-long rolling window on a 300MM-long data set. (See the supplied [bench.py.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19735182/bench.py.txt).) A single run of the test takes approx. 6-8 seconds and consumes ~15GB of RAM on a 32-GB RAM PC.
