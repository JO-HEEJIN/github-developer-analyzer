psf/requests,6923,Don't normalise or double-escape urls,"### Summary

I recently hit a url that I could not retrieve with `requests`, but that can be retrieved using another client executing an identical http request.  Specifically: When a url contains a percent-escaped tilde `~` (i.e. `%7E`), `requests` behaves differently than any other http client that I tried and performs unneeded normalization.  In addition to that, it double encodes invalid urls, which again differs from any other client.

### Testing

To illustrate this, I wrote some test code that records the paths that a variety of clients request.  In addition to `requests`, I tested the following http client libraries / browsers across `python`, `java`, `go`, `C`, `js` and `rust`. All http clients that I tested behave the same and use the target as-is, except `requests`. `requests` normalizes `%7E` to `~`:

The test code (server + automation to run all listed clients against it) is available here: https://github.com/moben/bugs/tree/aa8e4eb928e8189f5d863748d6d06e980d4f8a87/requests_http_location

The test server redirects `/v` to `f""/v/%7E/-._~/{urllib.parse.quote(string.printable)}""`, i.e. `/v/%7E/-._~/0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ%21%22%23%24%25%26%27%28%29%2A%2B%2C-./%3A%3B%3C%3D%3E%3F%40%5B%5C%5D%5E_%60%7B%7C%7D~%20%09%0A%0D%0B%0C`

All clients listed above use this verbatim, but `requests` normalizes it to `/v/~/....`.  Note: I originally thought this was specific to redirects, but it also happens when passing the url directly to `requests.get`.

### Root Cause & Proposed Fix

You might object that some of the tested clients are built on each other so they should be one data point.  But on the other hand, note that `requests` behaves differently from `urllib3` here.

The reason for `requests` differing from `urllib3` can be found in the history of the current normalization: The normalization (`requote_uri`) was added in 2013 in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/1361 to resolve https://github.com/psf/requests/issues/1360.  But in 2019 handling of invalid urls was also solved in `urllib3` in https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/pull/1647.  Not only does the `urllib3` implementation more closely match what all other clients are doing and does not change valid urls.  It also means that `requests` is double-encoding invalid uris.  If the url is invalid we probably can't expect much but the path that `requests` uses has no chance to decode to the same that any other client uses, even to the most lenient server.

I believe the best way to fix this is to simply drop the ""requoting"" that `requests` is doing and rely on `urllib3`'s implementation here: https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/blob/main/src/urllib3/util/url.py#L227
This gives the same behavior as (almost, see below) all other clients for valid urls and avoids the double encoding for invalid ones.  In my test code, this is `requests-patched`.


### Further notes

I also tested weird and invalid url edge cases:

- When percent-encoding all characters, including alphanumeric and `-._~`, one other client differs from the rest. `chrome` decodes specifically `.`.  I believe this to be a rather esotheric test case because unlike `~`, which became unreserved in RFC 3986 compared to RFC 1738, these characters were always unreserved.
- For invalid uris (broken percent encoding, unencoded characters) behavior differs wildly.  But all clients except `requests` use a url that decodes to the same string via e.g. `urllib.parse.unquote`.  (`requests` differs because of the double encoding)

It can of course be argued that the server should treat `%7E` and `~` in my original test case the same.  But in the interest of interoperability I believe it still makes sense to align with what every other client is doing and also drop the double encoding.

## Why this is better at scale:
Avoids full split if no semicolon (fast path).
Does only one split on =, minimizes string churn.
Avoids multiple .strip() calls — chains them efficiently.
Fewer allocations and GC impact.

psf/requests,6918,Fix incorrect Content-Length for StringIO with multi-byte characters,"This PR fixes issue #6917 where `io.StringIO` objects containing multi-byte characters report incorrect Content-Length headers.

## The issue
When using `io.StringIO` objects with multi-byte characters (like emoji), the Content-Length header is incorrectly set to the character count instead of the byte count. This happens because `StringIO.tell()` reports character positions, not byte positions.

For example, the emoji ""💩"" is 1 character but 4 bytes in UTF-8. With the current implementation, the Content-Length header incorrectly shows 1 instead of 4.

## The fix
The solution ensures that `io.StringIO` objects correctly report their UTF-8 encoded byte length by:
1. Detecting when the object is an `io.StringIO` instance
2. Reading the entire content and calculating its UTF-8 encoded length
3. Restoring the original position to maintain the object's state

I've added a test case that reproduces the issue and verifies the fix works with emoji characters.",closed,2025-03-22T10:13:13+00:00,2025-03-24T23:24:44+00:00,2025-03-24T02:04:31+00:00,,c65e5a60593adafdb8a2b6205209aa6e0b6658c5,hackspaces,20,0,2,10,0,1,False,https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6918,{}

psf/requests,6901,Fix SSL verification error,"This is a dedicated PR to fix [#6900](https://github.com/psf/requests/issues/6900).

As I said in the issue, this looks like a bug of `requests_toolbelt` but turns out that it belongs to the `requests` itself.
Basically, what `HostHeaderSSLAdapter` does is quite simple:
```python
    def send(self, request, **kwargs):
        # HTTP headers are case-insensitive (RFC 7230)
        host_header = None
        for header in request.headers:
            if header.lower() == ""host"":
                host_header = request.headers[header]
                break

        connection_pool_kwargs = self.poolmanager.connection_pool_kw

        if host_header:
            connection_pool_kwargs[""assert_hostname""] = host_header
        elif ""assert_hostname"" in connection_pool_kwargs:
            # an assert_hostname from a previous request may have been left
            connection_pool_kwargs.pop(""assert_hostname"", None)

        return super(HostHeaderSSLAdapter, self).send(request, **kwargs)
```
As you can see, it simply set `assert_hostname` to the custom SNI for the `urllib3.poolmanager.connection_pool_kw`.

When the proxy is set, the function `adapters.py!proxy_manager_for()` forgets to copy the `connection_pool_kwargs` property from the current `poolmanager`, which will cause the SSL verification exception when the user is doing the request with the custom SNI and self-signed certificate.

While messing around with the tests cases in `test_utils.py`, I ran into a weird error, a completely unrelated unit test began to fail!

This test turned out to be the test for the the function `extract_zipped_paths` in `utils.py`. It seems that this function tries to extract a zipped file to a specific location, but doesn't do so if a file already exists at that location.

In the unit test for this function, the test file itself is being used to validate whether the file is properly extracted post zipping. However, after running the test suite once, the zipped file is never replaced again! This led to newer versions of this file being compared with an older version, which ultimately caused the test case to fail in the `filecmp` assertion.

Instead of me having to `rm -rf` it every time, I decided to include a minor cleanup step in the test case itself. Hope this helps out any future devs!

psf/requests,6882,Enhance raise_for_status() to include response content,"#  Improve raise_for_status() to Include Response Content

## Description:
Currently, the `raise_for_status()` method in `requests.models.Response` raises an `HTTPError` but does not include the response content in the exception message. This can make debugging difficult, especially when APIs return meaningful error messages in the response body.

## Proposed Change  
Modify `raise_for_status()` to append a snippet of the response content (if available) to the exception message. Example:  

## Why This Matters:

- Helps developers quickly understand API errors without manually inspecting the response body.

- Aligns with common practices in other HTTP client libraries.


## Example Use Case
_**Before :**_ 
requests.exceptions.HTTPError: 403 Client Error: Bad Request for url: https://api.example.com

_**After :**_
requests.exceptions.HTTPError: 403 Client Error: Bad Request for url: https://api.example.com
Response: {""error"": ""Invalid token""}

<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>

psf/requests,6866,Adding host details in proxy headers,"**Issue:**
The connect request does not include host details when operating in a proxy environment. This can lead to failures in establishing a proper connection, as the host information is essential for routing the request through the proxy.

**Code Explanation:**
To address this issue, the following approach is used:

Check for Host in Proxy Settings:
If the proxy_kwargs dictionary contains a host key, it indicates that host details are available.

Add Host to Proxy Headers:
These host details are added to the proxy_headers dictionary under the Host key. By doing so, the host information is explicitly included in the proxy headers, ensuring that the connect request incorporates the correct routing details.

Impact:
Including the host details in the proxy_headers ensures that the connect request is properly formed and able to route through the proxy environment without any missing information. This resolves the issue and enhances connectivity reliability",open,2025-01-03T03:49:24+00:00,2025-01-03T13:52:37+00:00,,,3d10c93a499a7fd1d677c17891a5a1b921a75d44,HarikrishnanTechie,5,1,1,1,0,1,False,https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6866,{}

psf/requests,6853,Speed up function _init by 11% in src/requests/status_codes.py,"### Reason for Raising the PR

 The changes aim to optimize the given requests library code for better performance and most widely used function status_Code, we think we can make a few improvements. This includes eliminating unnecessary global variable modifications and reducing redundant iterations. Also we have removed the `sorted` function call as `_codes` is statically defined in the code and its keys are already in ascending order, sorting becomes unnecessary. 
 
### 📄 `_init()` in `src/requests/status_codes.py`

📈 Performance improved by **`11%`** (**`0.11x` faster**) 
The `_init()` function is executed every time the `requests.status_codes` module is imported. Given the widespread usage of this library, even minor inefficiencies can have a significant cumulative impact across applications.

⏱️ Runtime went down from **`4.45 milliseconds`** to **`4.01 milliseconds`** (best of `118` runs on ubuntu machine)


### Changes Made.
1. **Merged Initialization Loops**: Instead of updating the `__doc__` attribute in a separate loop, the document string is constructed during the main loop.
2. **Minimized Global Access**: The global `__doc__` is only modified once after the loop, avoiding repeated global lookups.
3. **Avoided Redundant Code**: Reduced the code by merging the setting of doc lines into a single list append inside the loop.

These changes should make the function more efficient in terms of runtime while preserving the original functionality.

### Representation Differences:
Starting from Python 3.8, the string representation of an OrderedDict has changed slightly.
In earlier versions, OrderedDict objects were represented as:
```python
OrderedDict([('key', 'val')])
```
In Python 3.8 and later, the `OrderedDict` has a more streamlined string representation, shown as:
```python
OrderedDict({'key': 'val'})
```

The Python 3.8 and lower versions are [already considered End of Life by Python](https://devguide.python.org/versions/), so there is no need to build the test around the older representation for OrderedDict.",open,2024-12-07T17:52:57+00:00,2024-12-07T17:52:57+00:00,,,50f582c69298c0a9341eb964dfedba8c4166396a,Sklyvan,2,2,1,0,0,1,False,https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6839,{}

<h1>CodeQL Action Changelog</h1>
<p>See the <a href=""https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases"">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>
<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>

<li>Bump the minimum CodeQL bundle version to 2.14.6. <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2549"">#2549</a></li>
<li>Fix an issue where the <code>upload-sarif</code> Action would fail with &quot;upload-sarif post-action step failed: Input required and not supplied: token&quot; when called in a composite Action that had a different set of inputs to the ones expected by the <code>upload-sarif</code> Action. <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2557"">#2557</a></li>

<h2>3.26.13 - 14 Oct 2024</h2>
<p>No user facing changes.</p>
<h2>3.26.12 - 07 Oct 2024</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Upcoming breaking change</em>: Add a deprecation warning for customers using CodeQL version 2.14.5 and earlier. These versions of CodeQL were discontinued on 24 September 2024 alongside GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10, and will be unsupported by CodeQL Action versions 3.27.0 and later and versions 2.27.0 and later. <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2520"">#2520</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you are using one of these versions, please update to CodeQL CLI version 2.14.6 or later. For instance, if you have specified a custom version of the CLI using the 'tools' input to the 'init' Action, you can remove this input to use the default version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternatively, if you want to continue using a version of the CodeQL CLI between 2.13.5 and 2.14.5, you can replace <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3.26.11</code> and <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2.26.11</code> in your code scanning workflow to ensure you continue using this version of the CodeQL Action.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>3.26.11 - 03 Oct 2024</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Upcoming breaking change</em>: Add support for using <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> to programmatically consume CodeQL Action debug artifacts.</p>
<p>Starting November 30, 2024, GitHub.com customers will <a href=""https://github.blog/changelog/2024-04-16-deprecation-notice-v3-of-the-artifact-actions/"">no longer be able to use <code>actions/download-artifact@v3</code></a>. Therefore, to avoid breakage, customers who programmatically download the CodeQL Action debug artifacts should set the <code>CODEQL_ACTION_ARTIFACT_V4_UPGRADE</code> environment variable to <code>true</code> and bump <code>actions/download-artifact@v3</code> to <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> in their workflows. The CodeQL Action will enable this behavior by default in early November and workflows that have not yet bumped to <code>actions/download-artifact@v3</code> to <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> will begin failing then.</p>
<p>This change is currently unavailable for GitHub Enterprise Server customers, as <code>actions/upload-artifact@v4</code> and <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> are not yet compatible with GHES.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.19.1. <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2519"">#2519</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>3.26.10 - 30 Sep 2024</h2>
<ul>
<li>We are rolling out a feature in September/October 2024 that sets up CodeQL using a bundle compressed with <a href=""http://facebook.github.io/zstd/"">Zstandard</a>. Our aim is to improve the performance of setting up CodeQL. <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2502"">#2502</a></li>

<blockquote>
<h1>CodeQL Action Changelog</h1>
<p>See the <a href=""https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases"">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>
<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>
<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>
<p>No user facing changes.</p>
<h2>3.26.0 - 06 Aug 2024</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Deprecation:</em> Swift analysis on Ubuntu runner images is no longer supported. Please migrate to a macOS runner if this affects you. <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2403"">#2403</a></li>
<li>Bump the minimum CodeQL bundle version to 2.13.5. <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2408"">#2408</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>3.25.15 - 26 Jul 2024</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.18.1. <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2385"">#2385</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>3.25.14 - 25 Jul 2024</h2>
<ul>
<li>Experimental: add a new <code>start-proxy</code> action which starts the same HTTP proxy as used by <a href=""https://github.com/github/dependabot-action""><code>github/dependabot-action</code></a>. Do not use this in production as it is part of an internal experiment and subject to change at any time. <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2376"">#2376</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>3.25.13 - 19 Jul 2024</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add <code>codeql-version</code> to outputs. <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2368"">#2368</a></li>
<li>Add a deprecation warning for customers using CodeQL version 2.13.4 and earlier. These versions of CodeQL were discontinued on 9 July 2024 alongside GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9, and will be unsupported by CodeQL Action versions 3.26.0 and later and versions 2.26.0 and later. <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2375"">#2375</a>
<ul>
<li>If you are using one of these versions, please update to CodeQL CLI version 2.13.5 or later. For instance, if you have specified a custom version of the CLI using the 'tools' input to the 'init' Action, you can remove this input to use the default version.</li>
<li>Alternatively, if you want to continue using a version of the CodeQL CLI between 2.12.6 and 2.13.4, you can replace <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3.25.13</code> and <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2.25.13</code> in your code scanning workflow to ensure you continue using this version of the CodeQL Action.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>3.25.12 - 12 Jul 2024</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improve the reliability and performance of analyzing code when analyzing a compiled language with the <code>autobuild</code> <a href=""https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/codeql-code-scanning-for-compiled-languages#codeql-build-modes"">build mode</a> on GitHub Enterprise Server. This feature is already available to GitHub.com users. <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2353"">#2353</a></li>
<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.18.0. <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2364"">#2364</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>3.25.11 - 28 Jun 2024</h2>

<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.6. <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2352"">#2352</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>3.25.10 - 13 Jun 2024</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.5. <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2327"">#2327</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>3.25.9 - 12 Jun 2024</h2>
<ul>
<li>Avoid failing database creation if the database folder already exists and contains some unexpected files. Requires CodeQL 2.18.0 or higher. <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2330"">#2330</a></li>
<li>The init Action will attempt to clean up the database cluster directory before creating a new database and at the end of the job. This will help to avoid issues where the database cluster directory is left in an inconsistent state. <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2332"">#2332</a></li>

psf/requests,6770,Header-based auth class,"This adds a short and simple header-based auth backend (and tests!). This allows greater flexibility in auth mechanisms out of the box.

For example, I'm working on on an internal library to interface with OGC services and three providers use three different auth mechanisms. Being able to consolidate this via the auth parameter seems like the correct solution.

It's worth noting that because of when this executes, auth objects override the headers provided both by the session and request call. This has been appropriately documented, and I don't believe any other option would be preferable.

Looks like someone proposed this in 2018 (#4823) but was rejected because of a feature freeze at the time.

If this is acceptable, would the team be interested in something similar like HTTPParamAuth that uses a dict of parameters in a similar fashion? Going back to my library example, one provider uses oauth, which requests supports, one uses headers, and one uses a custom api key parameter.

psf/requests,6731,Address certificate loading regression,"## Overview
This PR is intended to address two distinct issues introduced with the default cert optimizations originally introduced in 2.32.0. While we continue to refine the settings considered when opting into our optimized context, we'll no longer use the new default if any custom cert values are supplied. This addresses the concurrency issues raised in #6726.

The second piece of this will be ensuring that when opting out of the default SSLContext, we're still supplying to the default CA Cert bundle correctly. This addresses the problems noticed in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6710#issuecomment-2137802782 and #6730.

## Considerations

We're now duplicating a decent chunk of the [logic from cert_verify](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/0e322af87745eff34caffe4df68456ebc20d9068/src/requests/adapters.py#L324-L357) inside [_urllib3_request_context](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/0e322af87745eff34caffe4df68456ebc20d9068/src/requests/adapters.py#L115-L128) but without our validation exceptions. That's a potential vector for behavioral shifts in the future. We _could_ consolidate some of this behavior in one place but it's going to require constructing a dict and using `setattr` on our `conn` in `cert_verify` while setting `pool_kwargs` in `_urllib3_request_context`. I started writing that up but it feels clunky. This is probably going to be a tradeoff of risking drift like we have with Session settings and binding the two behaviors together too tightly.

## Testing
I'd like to codify the issues we've encountered through the whole 2.32.x saga in tests to hopefully avoid this in the future. Doing it cleanly without relying on external endpoints is proving to be a bit more involved than I'd like. I think we can harness some of the infrastructure added in #6662, but I haven't had a chance to really dig into that.",open,2024-05-31T19:05:10+00:00,2025-05-02T22:56:17+00:00,,,f2fd171d0ff4cb1509a1d72fdd0458cd47d5dbbb,nateprewitt,31,15,1,7,2,3,False,https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6731,"{""sigmavirus24"": [{""state"": ""COMMENTED"", ""submitted_at"": ""2024-05-31T19:42:08+00:00""}], ""nateprewitt"": [{""state"": ""COMMENTED"", ""submitted_at"": ""2024-05-31T19:52:40+00:00""}], ""Pjrich1313"": [{""state"": ""APPROVED"", ""submitted_at"": ""2024-10-31T07:09:29+00:00""}, {""state"": ""COMMENTED"", ""submitted_at"": ""2024-10-31T12:25:06+00:00""}, {""state"": ""COMMENTED"", ""submitted_at"": ""2025-01-06T11:37:13+00:00""}, {""state"": ""COMMENTED"", ""submitted_at"": ""2025-01-24T23:00:54+00:00""}]}"

As described [here](https://github.com/psf/requests/issues/6707#issuecomment-2122490651), we will be deprecating the existing `get_connection` API, and custom adapters will need to migrate their existing `get_connection` implementations to use `get_connection_with_tls_context`.

psf/requests,6709,Add default timeout,"This adds a default connect and read timeout value for all usage of Requests. This is to solve a long-standing issue where some systems do not have a sufficiently low default value.

Personally, I'd want these values to be much lower, but a 10 second connection timeout and a 30 second read timeout seem like they should be enough to avoid problems for the edge cases of users while also not being so large that they're basically ineffective.

psf/requests,6705,v2.32.0,"2.32.0 (2024-05-20)
-------------------

**Security**
- Fixed an issue where setting `verify=False` on the first request from a
  Session will cause subsequent requests to the _same origin_ to also ignore
  cert verification, regardless of the value of `verify`.
  (https://github.com/psf/requests/security/advisories/GHSA-9wx4-h78v-vm56)

**Improvements**
- `verify=True` now reuses a global SSLContext which should improve
  request time variance between first and subsequent requests. It should
  also minimize certificate load time on Windows systems when using a Python
  version built with OpenSSL 3.x. (#6667)
- Requests now supports optional use of character detection
  (`chardet` or `charset_normalizer`) when repackaged or vendored.
  This enables `pip` and other projects to minimize their vendoring
  surface area. The `Response.text()` and `apparent_encoding` APIs
  will default to `utf-8` if neither library is present. (#6702)

**Bugfixes**
- Fixed bug in length detection where emoji length was incorrectly
  calculated in the request content-length. (#6589)
- Fixed deserialization bug in JSONDecodeError. (#6629)
- Fixed bug where an extra leading `/` (path separator) could lead
  urllib3 to unnecessarily reparse the request URI. (#6644)

**Deprecations**

- Requests has officially added support for CPython 3.12 (#6503)
- Requests has officially added support for PyPy 3.9 and 3.10 (#6641)
- Requests has officially dropped support for CPython 3.7 (#6642)
- Requests has officially dropped support for PyPy 3.7 and 3.8 (#6641)

**Documentation**
- Various typo fixes and doc improvements.

**Packaging**
- Requests has started adopting some modern packaging practices.
  The source files for the projects (formerly `requests`) is now located
  in `src/requests` in the Requests sdist. (#6506)
- Starting in Requests 2.33.0, Requests will migrate to a PEP 517 build system
  using `hatchling`. This should not impact the average user, but extremely old
  versions of packaging utilities may have issues with the new packaging format.",closed,2024-05-20T15:30:48+00:00,2025-05-21T00:05:20+00:00,2024-05-20T15:46:49+00:00,2024-05-20T15:46:49+00:00,d6ebc4a2f1f68b7e355fb7e4dd5ffc0845547f9f,nateprewitt,48,2,2,0,0,1,True,https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6705,"{""sethmlarson"": [{""state"": ""APPROVED"", ""submitted_at"": ""2024-05-20T15:45:41+00:00""}]}"
psf/requests,6702,Allow optional char detection dependencies in post-packaging,"This PR is a proposal to relax our requirement to have a character detection library present with all installations of Requests. While we cannot remove our reliance on `charset_normalizer` or `chardet`, there are use cases where Requests is repackaged in applications or other tools that do not need our character detection behavior. These changes will enable them to remove those dependencies from their installation.

The current use case for this shift is to allow `pip` to remove these dependencies entirely. That should slim the package ~2MB in 24.1.0 and avoid the overhead of importing the unneeded dependency.",closed,2024-05-14T22:25:35+00:00,2024-05-22T08:08:55+00:00,2024-05-15T00:15:19+00:00,2024-05-15T00:15:19+00:00,0c030f78d24f29a459dbf39b28b4cc765e2153d7,nateprewitt,60,23,5,0,1,1,True,https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6702,"{""sigmavirus24"": [{""state"": ""APPROVED"", ""submitted_at"": ""2024-05-15T00:15:13+00:00""}], ""nijel"": [{""state"": ""COMMENTED"", ""submitted_at"": ""2024-05-22T08:08:55+00:00""}]}"
